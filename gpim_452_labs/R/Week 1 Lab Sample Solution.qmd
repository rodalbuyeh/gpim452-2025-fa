```{r message = FALSE}

# Libraries used in file

library(tidyverse)
```

**Part I**

```{r}

# Create a vector and do something to it

odd_nums <- c (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13)
odd_nums + 1
odd_nums * 2
```

This code creates a vector of odd numbers. It then adds 1 to each number and also multiplies each number by 2.

**Part II**

```{r}

# Create a tibble and print one of the columns

my_nums <- tibble(odd_nums,
                  even_nums = c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24))

my_nums$even_nums
```

My tibble has 2 columns and 7 rows.
