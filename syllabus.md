This course provides an introduction to the logic and practice of data science as used in policy making, program evaluation, and corporate enterprise. We do this with extensive, hands-on work with real data using the R statistical computing environment. This course emphasizes the opportunities and challenges of working with high dimensional data, as opposed to the memory and algorithmic challenges associated with big data. The course emphasizes the process of data gathering, pre-processing, and visualization. We then turn to the logic of machine learning, including model selection and hyperparameter tuning.

This course will not magically make you a data scientist, an expert in ‚Äúbig data‚Äù, or a professional-grade programmer in 10 weeks. Rather, we aim to provide the conceptual background, ethical framework, and computational experience that will turn someone with policy expertise and social science training into a valuable member of a data science team.

### Learning Objectives
* Familiarity with the vocabulary and key concepts in data science
* Understand the difference between big data and high-dimensional data and how one enables the exploitation of the other
* Understand the logic of predictive machine learning
* Gain conceptual understanding and hands on experience with some of the most frequently used ML tools
* See how policymakers and governments apply data science in real world situations
* Develop an appreciation for ethical concerns that big data present, especially for governments

### Skills Objectives
* Good computing and workflow practices
* Recognizing potential problems or red flags in data
* Develop data science programming abilities in R
* Train ML models, use them in predictive modeling tasks, and evaluate their performance
* Produce compelling reports using Quarto/RMarkdown
* Develop skills for working in data-driven policy teams

### Assumed knowledge
This class is an advanced data-intensive elective. We assume the following:
* Completion of QM I and II or equivalent.
* Understanding of basic mathematical concepts and notation such as percent change, exponents and exponentiation, logarithms, summation ($\sum$). Familiarity with linear algebra and differential calculus will be helpful but not assumed.
* Understanding of basic statistical concepts such as probability, frequency, and sampling distributions; central tendency (mean, median, mode); variation (variance, standard deviation, quantile); and conditional probability.
* Familiarity with linear regression, its calculation and interpretation.
* Familiarity with basic statistical graphics (histogram, scatterplot).
* Some previous exposure to statistical computing in R

If these requirements do not apply to you, please contact the instructor immediately.

## üèõÔ∏è Course Structure

This course will follow a ‚Äúflipped‚Äù and hybrid format with analog, video, remote/online, and in-person components.

* **Individual Activities**: This includes reading, watching short lecture videos, listening to podcasts, and working on lab assignments. This work is expected to be completed prior to every large-group meeting.
* **Small Group Activities**: This includes meetings for your group projects. You can also take advantage of office hours, either individually or as small groups.
* **Large Group Activities**: These are our formal in-person class meetings. Some days will be short lectures, while others will be devoted to questions, case materials, guest speakers, or group work.

{: .warning }
**This class format will only work if everyone completes the individual work prior to group meetings.** Failure to do so will have negative effects on you and your colleagues. There may be a graded comprehension assessment at the beginning of some class meetings.

### Expectations
I expect that you will come to class **ON TIME** and prepared. In return, you can expect that I have selected the materials for a reason, will come prepared with a clear agenda, and will return all on-time assignments within a week.

### Email & Ed Forum policy
I will use email and the [Ed forum](https://edstem.org/us/courses/81870/discussion) regularly. I will do my best to respond to emails within 12 hours during the week and 24 hours on weekends. **I will NOT respond to email on Sundays.**

## üìù Assignments & Grading

Your score is a weighted average of the following:

| Component                   | Weight | Type       |
| :-------------------------- | :----- | :--------- |
| Participation               | 10%    | Individual |
| Lab exercises               | 19%    | Individual |
| Assignment #1               | 5%     | Group      |
| Assignment #2               | 10%    | Group      |
| Assignment #3               | 25%    | Group      |
| Final Exam                  | 30%    | Individual |
| Office hours visits (2 min) | 1%     | Individual |

There will be no extra credit or supplemental assignments.

### Lab Exercises
Each lab session has an associated set of R exercises, due by **11:59 PM on the Monday** following the lab. A good faith attempt will receive an acceptable grade. No late exercises will be accepted. Lab exercises should be your individual work.

### Class Project and Assignments
The core group assignment uses data from the Labor Action Tracker (LAT) to build a predictive model for labor actions in the USA. You will either predict if an action is a "strike" or predict *where* an action will happen. We will randomly assign groups of 4-5 people.

* **Assignment #1: Ideal data and team plan.** Due 11:59 PM on January 27.
    * Describe your ideal dataset, compare it to the LAT data, and provide an explicit team plan for the quarter.
* **Assignment #2: Locating labor actions.** Due 11:59 PM on February 17.
    * Decide how to handle actions with multiple locations, use an LLM to help assign lat/long coordinates to counties, and create a new county variable in the LAT data.
* **Assignment #3: A data analysis report.** Due 8:00 AM on March 17.
    * A short report (max 4 pages/1500 words) summarizing your model, data adjustments, and conclusions. The report must be a cohesive `.pdf` produced with Quarto/RMarkdown, with all code embedded. An external party must be able to reproduce your report from your code.

### Final Exam
The final exam will be in class on **March 13**. It will cover conceptual, practical, and ethical issues from the course. The exam is closed-book, but you may use one 3‚Äùx5‚Äù card of hand-written notes.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Course Rules

### Maintaining Academic Integrity
I take academic honesty seriously. You may discuss work with others, but all analytic work is expected to be your own. You must appropriately cite all sources. All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be referred to the office of academic integrity.

### Use of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools
Generative AI can be a helpful tool, but it poses challenges. Some assignments will require you to use it. When using AI, you are responsible for the accuracy, logic, and clarity of all content.

{: .warning }
**For every assignment, you must include an appendix with one of the following statements:**
1. "I/we certify that we did not use any LLM or generative AI tool in this assignment"
2. "I/we used \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ LLM/AI tool in this assignment."

If you disclose AI use, you must also state *why* you used it, reflect on whether it was helpful, and provide a link to the entire exchange. Failure to include this disclosure will be treated as using an AI tool without disclosure and reported. **AI tools are forbidden during in-class exams.**

### Submitting written work
All written work must be submitted as a `.pdf` file produced using Quarto/RMarkdown via Turnitin.com. You must also submit your `.qmd` or `.rmd` source file.

### Late assignments & make up exam policy
Late assignments will be penalized one percentage point for every hour late. No assignments will be accepted more than 48 hours after the due date without a University-approved and documented excuse. There will be no make-up exams without a documented excuse (e.g., illness, family emergency).

### Grade disputes
To dispute a grade, you must submit a written memo of no more than 400 words explaining the error within seven calendar days of the assignment being returned.

### Students with Disabilities
Students requesting accommodations must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter from the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD). Please present your AFA letter to me privately at least two weeks before an exam so accommodations can be arranged.
