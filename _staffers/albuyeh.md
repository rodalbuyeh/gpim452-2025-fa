about: |
  I'm a data scientist and educator focused on the intersection of applied machine learning, scalable systems, and public impact. My academic background includes a PhD in Political Science from the University of Southern California, and I currently teach in both the data science and applied AI programs at UC San Diego and the University of San Diego.

  In industry, I've led machine learning efforts across domains including healthcare, finance, and consumer tech--most recently as Principal Data Scientist at Labcorp. My work spans from deep learning and time-series forecasting to MLOps and generative AI, with an emphasis on deploying models in complex, real-world systems.

  At GPS, I aim to bridge technical depth with policy relevance. My teaching is rooted in practical implementation--helping students develop a rigorous understanding of data systems, while cultivating the judgment to apply them responsibly in global and institutional contexts.

  Outside the classroom, I am in the early stages of a stealth startup, train mixed martial arts, and explore San Diego with my family.
