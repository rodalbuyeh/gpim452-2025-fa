## Why this course exists {.smaller}

::: {.fragment}
Policy problems are increasingly **data-mediated**. We need people who can:
:::


::: {.absolute top="30%" left="5%" width="45%"}
- Reason with uncertainty and causality
- Build and critique applied ML systems
- Move comfortably between **domain knowledge** and **computational practice**
- Communicate clearly to decision makers

:::


## Our goal

::: {.fragment}
Help you become a **high-functioning member of a data science team** in policy settings—not to turn you into a production ML engineer in 10 weeks.
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Your role:** The **practitioner** who can move fluidly through the data science workflow. 
:::

::: {.fragment}
We'll learn:
:::

- `Raw Data` → `Features` → `Models` → `Evaluation` → `Policy Recommendations`

::: {.fragment}
...while keeping ethics, feasibility, and stakeholder needs front-of-mind.
:::

## Key terms {.smaller}

- **Data science**: a multidisciplinary process for turning data into insight and action through computing, statistics, and domain expertise
- **Big data**: massive volume/velocity/variety; *systems* problems (storage, parallelism)
- **High-dimensional data**: many features \(p\) relative to samples \(n\); *statistical* problems (overfitting, sparsity, selection); a primary focus of this course
- **Machine learning**: algorithms that learn patterns from data to make decisions or predictions
- **Supervised learning**: algorithms that generalize from labeled data to predict/label new cases; evaluation is central
- **AI**: systems that perform tasks associated with human intelligence; ML is a major subfield, and deep learning is a major sub-subfield

::: {.fragment}
::: callout-tip
**Course emphasis**: We focus on *high dimensionality* and the **workflow** that makes data science useful in policy—collection → cleaning → visualization → modeling → evaluation → communication.
:::
:::

## Two faces of “big”

::: {layout-ncol=2}
### Large *n*
- Millions of rows
- Systems concerns (I/O, distributed compute)
- Examples: clickstreams, sensor logs, customer transactions

### Large *p*
- Thousands of features/variables
- Statistical concerns (feature selection, regularization)
- Examples: survey responses, social media text, genomics, satellite imagery features
:::

## Case study set-up {.smaller}

**Blumenstock et al. (Science, 2015):** Can call-detail records and ancillary data predict *wealth* at fine geographic scales?

::: {.fragment}
**The approach:**
- Survey 856 Rwandans on assets/wealth, link to their phone records
- Engineer thousands of features from call patterns, mobility, social networks
- Use machine learning (elastic net) to predict wealth from phone behavior
- Scale predictions to 1.5M subscribers across Rwanda
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Key results:**
- Strong correlation (r=0.68) between predicted and actual individual wealth
- District-level predictions highly accurate (r=0.92) vs. government surveys
- Cost: $12K and 4 weeks vs. traditional surveys at $1M+ and 12-18 months
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Policy implications:** Real-time poverty mapping, targeted aid, rapid policy evaluation
:::

::: {.fragment}
**Ethical concerns:** Privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, data governance
:::

::: notes
We’re not reproducing the paper—just using it to motivate the workflow and the ethical stakes.

:::

## What’s the transferable workflow? {.smaller}

**Data → Features → Models → Evaluation → Communication**

- **Gather**: APIs, databases, scraping, provided data, surveys
- **Pre-process**: tidy, validate, document
- **Engineer**: create informative features; reduce or increase dimensionality when needed
- **Model**: start simple; prefer transparent baselines
- **Validate**: train/validate/test; fit-for-purpose metrics
- **Communicate**: visual, concise, reproducible; decision-focused

::: {.fragment}
::: callout-important
**You’ll practice this repeatedly** in labs and a project-like sequence. We care *how* you work as much as *what* you produce.
:::
:::

## Ethics, privacy, governance

- **Re-identification risk**: seemingly anonymous metadata can be deanonymized
- **Consent & legitimacy**: why would/should a telecom share data? Under what governance?
- **Bias & representativeness**: who has phones? whose patterns look “normal”?
- **Use vs. abuse**: allocative benefits vs. surveillance harms
- **Accountability**: audit trails, reproducibility, policy transparency

::: notes
Invite students to name one risk and one mitigation. Capture on the board.
:::
